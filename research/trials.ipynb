It is critical that you work in c lose collaboration with \\nsenior medical, nursing and allied health staff , along with our administrative support \\nofficers.  \\nWe have outlined some useful practice points will help you to settle into our department \\nsmoothly. \\nEducational and training resources \\nElectronic medical records \\nTownsville Cancer Centre uses MOSAIQ as its EMR. Please become familiar with \\nMOSAIQ by contacting the CNC for MOSAIQ on 32888 or through  our administrative \\nsupport officers 44331671 prior to commencement. We assume that you are familiar with \\nthe ieMR, the THHS-wide EMR. \\nChemotherapy protocol \\neviQ is a very useful website to learn chemotherapy protocols and side -effects. It also \\ncontains information about managing extravasation (www.eviq.org.au). \\nNB: RMOs and interns are not expected to write chemotherapy orders. When \\nwriting oral chemotherapy, targeted agents and colony stimulating factors, please \\nexercise caution and follow the advice of your registrars and consultants.  \\nMedication prescribing \\nQuality of inpatient medication prescribing can be improved by adhering to the THHS \\nguide for inpatient medication prescription. \\nEnd of life care bedside tutorial and introduction to telehealth \\nThese two topics are available on YouTube (searchable using the titles) and are useful \\nresources for developing mental frameworks for approaching these topics. \\nBasic principles of oncology \\nClinical oncology for medical students is a useful resource for learning basic principles \\nof oncology care. \\n \\nhttp://wiki.cancer.org.au/oncologyformedicalstudents/Clinical_Oncology_for_Medical_\\nStudents'), Document(metadata={'source': {'source': 'data\\\\Medical_Oncology_Handbook_.pdf', 'page': 5}}, page_content='4 \\n \\nDocumentation \\nSince funding for operations of medical departments are linked to their clinical activities, \\nit is important to use coding terminologies during documentation of patient notes. \\nIssues with central venous access devices  \\nWe use central lines commonly in oncology and therefore, it is prudent to be aware of \\nmanaging complications. As a rule, when it is difficult to draw blood from lines or inject \\nfluids, it is important to use imaging (including chest -Xray and linogram) for checking \\nthe position and viability before using the lines. Please seek advice when infection and \\nthrombosis are suspected/proven. We can rarely save lines using antibiotics  \\nSelf-care \\nPlease maintain physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Take  regular breaks as \\nmuch as possible and maintain effective work -life balance (This doesn’t mean work is \\nbad and life is good; it is about having a balance that suits your needs) . Please seek help \\nif you think you need help including emotional support and guidance. \\nDay unit \\n• Orientate with the Day-unit staff and introduce yourself to senior nursing \\nstaff and establish working relationships with them.   \\n• You are the first point of call for any issues in day unit and therefore, please \\nmake sure that you are always available during rostered hours. Day unit relies \\non effective discharge of patients to maintain flow. A delay due to one issue \\ncould delay the whole day’s operation and care of other patients. \\n• Infusion reactions are medical emergencies: You should always attend to a \\npatient having a reaction, leaving everything else. If you are not available, \\nplease make sure another doctor can attend the patient immediately. \\nClinics \\n• Being “On Time” is important! Clinics start on time so that patients can \\nreceive their chemotherapy in day unit without delays. \\n• If a patient is seen by the consultant in clinic, please ask them to sign the blue \\nform. \\nDealing with consultants and registrars \\nPlease don’t hesitate to seek help from senior medical staff. All changes in management \\nshould be discussed.

If there is a dose \\nincrease, it is possible only from the next cycle. \\n• All chemotherapy bookings are done through administration officers and day \\nunit schedulers. \\n• Initial chemotherapy orders should be counter-signed by a consultant. \\n• Please be familiar with important practice points for common medications as \\ndescribed in this hand book. \\nAdmitted patients \\n• Make sure they are seen by consultants within 24 hours of admission and on a \\nregular basis; \\n• Have an expected date of discharge and do the discharge planning, including \\ntimely completion of high-quality discharge summaries; ideally on the day \\nof discharge, using the national guide for discharge summaries. \\n• If a patient undergoing chemotherapy is admitted with complications, inform \\nthe day-unit and the treating consultant of any changes in treatment. It will \\nalso be important to document this episode on MOSAIQ for continuity of \\ncare and future planning including dose changes and addition of GCSF. \\n• If any oncology patient is admitted in another department or another hospital \\nwith complications, inform the treating consultant and document on \\nMOSAIQ. \\n• In-patient consults from other departments need to be seen on the same day, \\ndiscussed with or seen by the consultant on call and documented on \\nMOSAIQ. \\n• It is important to inform the consultant on call of any patients admitted to \\nmedical oncology. \\nRemember to use telehealth for appointments via our teleoncology coordinator.

However, in patients with incurable metastatic disease where quality of life is \\nparamount, dose delays or dose reductions are necessary. \\nPerformance status \\nThis is graded using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. \\n \\nGrade ECOG performance status \\n0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without \\nrestriction. \\n1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to \\ncarry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, \\noffice work \\n2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any \\nwork activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours \\n3 Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than \\n50% of waking hours \\n4 Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined \\nto bed or chair \\n \\nUsually, patients with ECOG grade > 2 are not fit for chemotherapy. The exception is \\nchemotherapy-sensitive cancers such as lymphoma and small cell lung cancers. The \\ndecision to offer chemotherapy must be individualised , depending upon factors such as \\nage of the patient, & comorbidities. For example, a young patient with metastatic breast'), Document(metadata={'source': {'source': 'data\\\\Medical_Oncology_Handbook_.pdf', 'page': 11}}, page_content='10 \\n \\ncancer with poor performance status could still be offered systemic treatments. Targeted \\nagents and endocrine therapy are usually tolerated better than chemotherapy. \\n \\nToxicity from previous cycles of systemic therapy \\nClinicians must assess whether a side effect is affecting QOL, performance status  or is \\nlife threatening: \\nFirst, determine the type and severity of side effects. \\nFor example, in patients with early breast cancers undergoing taxane chemotherapy, mild \\nperipheral neuropathy is acceptable. However, in patients undergoing fluorouracil-based \\ntherapy, ongoing or severe diarrhoea necessitates a dose  delay and dose reduction of \\nsubsequent cycles. \\nMid-cycle neutropenic fever usually requires dose reduction of the subsequent cycle \\nunless the cancer is curable. If the cancer is curable or a substantial duration of remission \\nis expected, prophylactic colo ny stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim (neulasta) \\nand/or antibiotics can reduce the risk of subsequent and opportunistic infections. \\n \\nNext, determine the effects on important organs, such as: \\n• Fertility. Discuss semen cryopreservation with men. Options for women \\nshould also be discussed, particularly in young women of child-bearing \\npotential and where curative intention treatment is planned.  Options include \\npreservation of egg, embryo and a piece of ovary is offered by some fertility \\ngroups. Women who wish to discuss this option should be referred to a \\nfertility specialist. \\n• Renal function, liver functions. \\n• Cardiac function. This may affect the dosage of anthracyclines (check \\nejection fraction before treatment begins and after every 2–3 cycles) and \\ntrastuzumab (check ejection fraction before treatment begins and every 3 \\nmonths during therapy). \\nToxicity is graded according to NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events1. \\n1. Blood parameters: \\na. Requires haematological and non-haematological parameters. \\n \\n1 National cancer institute common toxicity criteria (CTCAE, version 4.03, June \\n2010), National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute  . \\nhttp://ctep.cancer.gov.'), Document(metadata={'source': {'source': 'data\\\\Medical_Oncology_Handbook_.pdf', 'page': 12}}, page_content='11 \\n \\nFor most regimens, a neutrophil count >1.5 x 109/L and platelet count > 100 x \\n109/L are needed for safe administration of chemotherapy. For some regimens, \\nlower levels may be acceptable. \\nSingle agent bleomycin and vincristine  are not myelotoxic and administration is \\nnot affected by blood counts. \\nRenal function is important for cisplatin and carboplatin and liver function for \\ndocetaxel, Magnesium levels especially for cisplatin  and Calcium levels for \\ndenosumab. \\nAction - withhold treatment until recovery, then dose delay and/or dose reduction \\nafter discussion with senior staff. \\nb. Pregnancy test: For women of child bearing potential, perform beta HCG \\nbefore initiating treatment. \\n2. Non-haematological toxicity \\n(Also see the summary of common side effects for selected drugs on page 25). \\na. Diarrhoea – mainly 5FU based, Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, docetaxel. \\nAction - low threshold for withholding therapy if diarrhoea the day before , or \\nmoderate diarrhoea for longer than expected duration, or nocturnal diarrhoea. \\nb. Mucositis/mouth care. \\nc. Emesis. \\n   Action - (see anti-emetics) change class, change route, add another agent, or  \\n   reduction of chemotherapy dose. \\nd. Skin Rash. \\ne.

However, basic principles are as \\nfollows: \\n(Also refer to the Guide for inpatient medication prescription) \\n1. Pain:    Always find out the cause of the pain before prescribing analgesics. \\nTotal daily morphine requirement will guide the required daily slow release dose. \\nWhen prescribing breakthrough, the dose is 1/6th of the daily dose. So, if you are \\nincreasing the daily dose, breakthrough needs to increase as well. If oral intake is \\ndifficult—patches or infusional morphine are options. \\n4. Dyspnoea:    Again, find out the cause, for cancer related dyspnoea—nebulised \\nmorphine and anxiolytics could be helpful. \\nWhen to stop cancer treatment \\nA decision to stop treatment prematurely depends on the aim of the treatment. \\nFor curable cancers, it is acceptable to continue treatment with dose modifications. \\nHowever, life threatening or severe dose  limiting toxicities usually necessitate cessation \\nof treatment (eg. moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy with taxanes and oxaliplatin, \\nsevere enteritis from fluorouracil). Alternative regimens are sometimes available. \\nIf the cancer is incurable and th e toxicities severely interfere with the activities of daily \\nliving, treatment may have to be stopped. \\nDeteriorating performance status and organ function usually require cessation of \\ntreatment. Ongoing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia typically means the p atient is not \\ngoing to handle further chemotherapy. \\nIn case of patients with metastatic disease, palliative care team referral is done even when \\nthey are on active treatment, to improve symptom management and supportive care.'), Document(metadata={'source': {'source': 'data\\\\Medical_Oncology_Handbook_.pdf', 'page': 14}}, page_content='13 \\n \\nCommon side effects of systemic therapeutic agents \\n• Adriamycin/ Epirubicin    \\nBe aware of cumulative dose, perform cardiac function every 2-3cycles. \\n• Bleomycin-  \\nLung functions every 3 weeks (consider, discuss with consultant) \\n• Cisplatin \\nRenal function, Mg levels, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss/tinnitus. \\n• Carboplatin \\nAdjust dose based on renal function; Dose = AUC x (GFR+25).  \\n• 5-FU \\nDiarrhoea-In severe cases, it can be life threatening. \\nBefore proceeding with treatment, please make sure no diarrhoea on the day and \\non the previous day of chemotherapy.

IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other less \\ncommon inflammatory events4. \\nIn general, treatment of moderate or severe irAEs requires interruption of the checkpoint \\ninhibitor and the use of corticosteroid immunosuppression. Treatment is based upon the \\nseverity of the observed toxicity: \\n• For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment \\nwith the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should not be resumed \\nuntil symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids should be started \\nif symptoms do not resolve quickly. \\n• For patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) immune-\\nmediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be \\npermanently discontinued. High doses of corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 \\nmg/kg/day or equivalent) should be given. When symptoms subside to grade \\n1 or less, steroids can be gradually tapered over at least one month. \\n• Patients who will benefit from corticosteroids generally do so within days. If \\nsymptoms do not clearly improve, particularly after approximately three days \\nwith intravenous steroids, our approach is to administer infliximab (5 mg/kg) \\nrather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV corticosteroids. \\nIf symptoms persist after the first infliximab dose, a second dose of \\ninfliximab (5 mg/kg) can be repeated two weeks after the initial dose. \\n \\n \\nDetailed management of various toxicities is covered by Cancer Institute of NSW’s \\neviQ:Cancer Treatments Online site.

In patients who \\nremain premenopausal after che motherapy and have high risk disease , ovarian \\nsuppression with LHRH agonists or bilateral oophorectom y with exemestane or \\nTamoxifen is better than Tamoxifen alone.  Aromatase Inhibitors are not used \\nalone in premenopausal women.  \\nConsider 10 years of tamoxifen over 5 years of treatment, particularly for patients \\nat highest baseline risk eg where chemotherapy was indicated. \\nIn post-menopausal women  - Aromatase inhibitors are the preferred endocrine \\ntreatment unless contraindicated. In patients who cannot tolerate AI or where it is \\ncontraindicated, Tamoxifen is used.  \\nIn post-menopausal patients who start treatment with tamoxifen, switching to AI \\nafter 2-3 years is recommended. \\n5-10 additional years of aromatase inhibitors after 5 years of tamoxifen improves \\nsurvival in high-risk patients.  \\nFor patients on AIs and documented osteopaenia addition of bisphosphonates  \\ndecreases the risk of decline in bone density.  They are also encouraged to take \\nregular calcium and vitamin D tablets.  DEXA scans are done yearly to two yearly \\nfor monitoring bone health in patients on aromatase inhibitors. \\nChemotherapy regimens- \\n• Lower risk/Average risk- 4x TC,  \\n• High risk- 3x FEC- 3x D OR AC-weekly Taxol OR AC- dd Taxol. AC may \\nbe given in dose dense fashion (preferred if possible). \\n• In Her-2 positive disease, Trastuzumab is combined with Taxanes and not \\nwith anthracyclines because of risk of cardiac toxicity.

      "AI: Head and neck cancer refers to a group of biologically similar cancers that originate in the upper aerodigestive tract, which includes areas such as the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, oral cavity, and other nearby regions. These cancers are known for their potential complexity due to the anatomical structures involved. Treatment can vary based on whether the disease is resectable, unresectable, or if there is a need for organ preservation. For resectable disease, surgery is typically pursued, and postoperative radiotherapy with chemotherapy may improve survival in high-risk cases. When the disease is deemed unresectable or for the purpose of organ preservation, a combination of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy is often indicated. Metastatic head and neck cancer is treated with a regimen of chemotherapy, typically involving Cisplatin or Carboplatin in combination with 5FU/Capecitabine, and Nivolumab can be considered as a second-line treatment.\n"
